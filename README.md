# Midterm: Practical Part
The codes for each of the problems 1, 2 and 3 can be found in the corresponding folders.
## Problem 1
The ipynb file corresponding to the solution for problem 1 can be found inside the corresponding folder along with the images used.
## Problem 2
The python and ipynb files corresponding to the solution for problem 2 are inside the corresponding folder along with the images used, these are divided into two folders: mask, for images of faces with cameras, and no_mask for images without mask. To solve the exercise ORB and BFMarcher were used, then to generalise the results to more images different to the ones used to develop the program, the other images that will be used as tests must be images that fulfil certain characteristics of similarity with the images of development, for that reason it is recommended only to use the images in the folders mask and no_mask, in order to be able to see the satisfactory results obtained with the developed code.
## Problem 3
The python and ipynb files corresponding to the solution for problem 3 are inside the corresponding folder along with the correspondent dataset,which was used to solve this exercise.
